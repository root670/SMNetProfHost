Server application for StepMania Net Profile Manager. Stepmania Network Profiles
is a technology currently in development that allows players to host their
player profiles in the cloud. In addition, this project allows players to
generate iOS Passbook Passes that can be used to identify players using a
barcode scanner attached to a compatible OpenITG machine.

Update the config.json file to support your web server and make sure that the
correct permissions are set on the data directory.
